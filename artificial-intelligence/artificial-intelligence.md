## How to learn Artificial Intelligence?

In fact, we can consider both the answers as right, but in their own ways. Let’s try to summarize the definition. Artificial Intelligence is:

- An intelligent entity created by us (humans).
- It is capable of performing and carrying out tasks intelligently and we don’t even have to instruct it to do so.
-It is capable of acting and thinking humanely and rationally.

It’s an integral branch of CS/IT that aims to clone human intelligence in robotic machines. Robots, machines, or more commonly, AI systems are powered with advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms that make machines intelligent. However, the definition of AI has certainly altered in recent years. Earlier, even a simple function to perform calculations inside a calculator would have been considered to be an AI component. However, now, it’s just a mere computer program. Let’s understand how the various levels of AI exist.

Predominantly, we can categorize AI systems into 3 different levels. They are -

- **Artificial Narrow Intelligence** - This is also known as weak or narrow AI because it’s goal-oriented and designed to perform low-level simple tasks. Technologies such as Siri, Alexa, etc. fall under this category. It’s carried out through machine learning which specializes in only a particular area and solves that particular problem.

- **Artificial General Intelligence** - Also referred to as deep or strong AI, where machines can mimic human intelligence. A few of its properties include recognition, hypothesis testing, analogy, etc. Speech and facial recognition systems generally fall under this category. However, this category is still under heavy research and is not completely developed yet.

- **Artificial Super Intelligence** - It is just a vague concept. It’s supposed to develop in the coming future. It should be able to create and formulate its own set of emotions, do tasks more efficiently than humans in fields such as calculations, sports, art, etc.

## Applications of Artificial Intelligence

As discussed previously, Artificial Intelligence has its root buried in almost all the prominent fields prevalent today. With the evolution of big data, AI and ML have started to evolve. Working with AI and ML requires a ton of data to perform training on. In the earlier days, it was difficult to store such a huge volume of data, let alone perform analysis on such large datasets. But with the evolution of Big Data, it’s now possible to churn fruitful insights from large datasets.

AI and ML are also largely being used in cybersecurity to filter information and provide real-time insights on any aberrations. Some popular applications of Artificial Intelligence are:

- Facial Recognition.
- Detection of Cancers and Tumors in - Healthcare.
- Industrial Robots.
- Self-driving automobiles.
- Guidance of Missiles in defense systems.
- Machine Learning and analytics.

## Prerequisites

At the core of Artificial Intelligence, there are subjects that we have already learned in our high schools. They give you a good foundation to stand upon when you start learning the basics of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Some of these include -

- Computer Science fundamentals.
- Statistics and Probability.
- Linear Algebra including topics such as vectors, matrices, and derivatives.
- Calculus.
- Discrete mathematics.
- Data Structures.
- Algorithms and their analysis.
- Python or R programming.

If you want to learn AI to solve real-life problems, then there are tons of existing libraries and toolkits that will help you with almost any problem out there. But if you want to get into the research field, it’s best to brush up on your mathematical skills before foraying into AI.

If you are from a CS/IT background, you must have oiled data structures and algorithms almost throughout your curriculum. Having data structures and algorithms in your portfolio is always a good thing, and in this case, it’s even better. Finally, to carry out machine learning algorithms for training, you need to know the basics of any language that can carry out statistical computations. Usually, we go with either Python or R because both of them have got excellent sets of libraries that can implement any complex algorithms with a few lines of code.

## Roadmap To Learn Artificial Intelligence

One of the biggest reasons why people don’t directly jump into the field of Artificial Intelligence is because they don’t know where to start. There is a lot of technical jargon that comes in their way when they search for resources to learn Artificial Intelligence. In this topic, we will guide you through a detailed process using which you can easily begin your journey with AI.

### **Fundamentals**

The best way to start with AI is to brush up on your fundamentals. You can get started with basic mathematics and then preferably get your hands dirty on a coding language. It’s always recommended to go with Python because of its large and supportive community and tons of packages and libraries that will assist you throughout your journey.

Here’s something that you might want to brush upon.

- Matrices and Linear Algebra fundamentals.
- Calculus.
- Graph Theory.
- Vectors.
- Statistics and Probability.

Apart from this, there are a few tools that you might want to learn that will help you to handle data in a better way.

- Database basics.
    - SQL and Joins in SQL.
    - Relational and non-relational databases.
    - NoSQL databases.
- Tabular data (Excel).
- Data Frames and Data Series.
- Data Formats (JSON, CSV, XML).
- Regular Expressions.
- Extract, transform, and load data.

After having brushed up on these topics, it’s the perfect time to dive deep into the basics of a programming language that can handle data in a seamless manner. There are two options that we generally have - Python and R. Mostly, companies prefer Python over R due to the immense support that it provides. Here’s a roadmap to learn Python for Artificial Intelligence.

- Python basics - Expressions, variables, data structures, functions, packages such as pip, etc.
- After having learned the basics, next you need to learn some important data-handling libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib.
- Next, you should get your hands dirty on Virtual Environments and how to use Jupyter Notebooks/Labs effectively and efficiently.

Now, you are well equipped to go to take the next big step in your journey to learn Artificial Intelligence.

### **Data Preprocessing**

Now that you are able to manipulate data, it’s time to learn different techniques that will help you to convert unstructured data into structured data so that you can gain insights from it by applying Machine Learning algorithms. Such methods include -

- Principal Component Analysis.
- Dimensionality Reduction.
- Normalization.
- Data Scrubbing, handling missing values, etc.
- Unbiased estimators.
- Features extraction.
- Denoising and sampling.

These techniques will help you to organize your data to perform further analysis. From here, you have 3 directions to go to - Machine Learning, Data Scientist, and Data Engineer.

**Machine Learning Engineer**

Machine Learning is the application of algorithms that are trained on data to find certain patterns and features that would help us to make predictions and decisions based on new data. The better and accurate the algorithm, the better are the results. Hence, it’s of utmost importance that you select the most fitting algorithm for any problem statement. The general roadmap to learn Machine Learning is -

- Learn concepts such as types of input parameters and variables (categorical, ordinal, and numerical).
- Concepts such as cost functions and gradient descents.
- Overfitting, underfitting, training, testing, and validation data sets.
- Precision, recall, bias, and variance.

Post that, you can move ahead and learn the different categories of Machine Learning algorithms that will help you to solve specific problems.

The main categories are -

- **Supervised Learning** - Algorithms that are used to classify objects and also for regression problems.
- **Unsupervised Learning** - Clustering Algorithms.
- **Ensemble Learning** - Boosting, Bagging, and Stacking.
- **Reinforcement Learning** - Reward-based learning algorithms.

It’s not difficult to learn these algorithms and the intuition behind them, what’s difficult is to find out which algorithms will be best suited for a particular kind of problem. You can brush up on your skills through comprehensive practice.

**Data Scientist**

This is another career path that you can adopt in the field of AI. It involves playing with data and mathematical models to find out the right information hidden inside the data. The two main components in a data science course are - Statistics and Data Visualization.

The topics that you need to be well-aware of in statistics include -

- Probability theory.
- Continuous and Discrete Distributions.
- Hypothesis Testing.
- Summary Statistics and some important laws such as (LLN, CLT).

Apart from these career paths, you can also choose advanced subjects such as Deep Learning Engineer and Big Data Engineer. However, these paths require in-depth experience and knowledge on prerequisites such as Machine Learning and Data Engineering. This is the best and easiest pathway that you can adopt to start your journey in Artificial Intelligence.

Apart from these, there are other subfields of AI that you can explore. These include

- Object Recognition.
- Robotics.
- Speech Processing.
- Expert Systems.
- Natural Language Processing.

No matter what field or subfield they are working in, all of them are said to be AI engineers provided they are working in the above-mentioned fields. Their ultimate goal is to develop better artificially intelligent systems.
