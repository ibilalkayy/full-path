# Best Way to Become Android Developer – A Complete Roadmap

## What is Android?

Android is an open-source operating system, based on the Linux kernel and used in mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, etc. Further, it was developed for smartwatches and Android TV. Each of them has a specialized interface. Android has been one of the best-selling OS for smartphones. 

Android OS was developed by Android Inc. which Google bought in 2005. Various applications like games, music player, camera, etc. are built for these smartphones for running on Android. Google Play Store features quite 3.3 million apps. Today, Android remains dominant on a global scale. Approximately 75% of the world population prefers using Android as against 15% of iOS. It is an operating system that has a huge market for apps.

It is known to everyone that how popular is Android nowadays. Now the questions arise are, 
- Why Android(Decide the Goal First?)
- How to start? 
- Where to start? 
- What topics one should cover? etc.

## Why Android? (Decide the Goal First?)

So before jumping into the complete Roadmap of Android one should have a clear goal in his/her mind that why he/she wants to learn Android? Is it for your college academic projects? or is it for your long-term career? or do you want to build your apps to start your business? So first make a clear goal. Why do you want to learn Android? 

For example, if you want to learn Android for your college Academic projects then it’s enough to just learn the beginner things in Android. Similarly, if you want to build your long term career then you should learn the professional or advanced things also. So it’s on your hand and it’s your decision why you want to learn Android.

## How to Learn Android?

In Android, programming is done in two languages JAVA or Kotlin and XML(Extension Markup Language). The XML file deals with the design, presentation, layouts, blueprint, etc (as a front-end) while the JAVA or KOTLIN deals with working of buttons, variables, storing, etc (as a back-end). And the biggest confusion for an Android beginner is which language to choose between Java and Kotlin? So let me try to overcome the confusion first. 

### **Java or Kotlin?**

Java is the official language for Android App Development and consequently, it is the most used language as well. Many of the apps in the Play Store are built with Java and it is also the most supported language by Google.

Kotlin is a cross-platform programming language that may be used as an alternative to Java for Android App Development. It has also been introduced as a secondary “official” Java language in 2017. The only sizable difference is that Kotlin removes the superfluous features of Java such as null pointer exceptions. It also removes the necessity of ending every line with a semicolon. In short, Kotlin is much simpler for beginners to try as compared to Java and it can also be used as an “entry point” for Android App Development.

## Learning Resources

There are plenty of resources and videos available online and it’s confusing for developers where to start learning all the concepts. Initially, as a beginner, if you get overwhelmed with so many concepts then don’t be afraid and stop learning. Have patience, explore, and stay committed to it.

    The best way to learn Android is by developing some baby projects to some advanced projects.

## A Roadmap to Learn

Start with the Overview of Android. Read some android related blogs and also research some Android-related things. For example read blogs on Introduction to Android Development, History of Android, Different Versions of Android, and also topics like Why Kotlin will replace Java for Android App Development, etc. and make a complete mind makeup to start your journey on Android. 

### **1. Expertise in Java, Kotlin or Both**

An extensive knowledge of at least one of the two official Android development languages is the first Android developer required skill you’ll need. You have to be comfortable with Kotlin or Java programming languages.

What does that mean? You must have an advanced knowledge of their syntax and structure. In addition, you should understand the following concepts:

- Object-oriented fundamentals (e.g. inheritance, class, and static methods)
- Variables
- Lists
- Loops

If you’re learning Java, then you should also be confident with using JDK documentation to be able to quickly learn how to use different parts of the language.

### **2. Vital Android SDK concepts**

Android engineers should also be good at using the Android Software Development Kit (Android SDK). There are several areas you should be aware of:

- Fundamentals of Views, View Groups, and Layouts
- User input
- Ways to get data from the web
- Storing data
- Action bars
- Adapting apps for different screen sizes

You should also be familiar with Android documentation and various third-party resources that will help you quickly master any parts of SDK that are still unknown to you.

### **3. Decent Experience with SQL**

Almost every Android app needs to store data in some form, whether that’s the data of the app itself or user data. Correspondingly, your app should be integrated with a database so that you are able to manage the data.

This is why many employers are looking for an Android developer with SQL experience. Thus, it is a good idea to master this database management system to increase your chances to be hired.

### **4. Knowledge of Git**

This Android developer skill may not be strictly necessary depending on the company and your needs, but it’s good to have. You will most likely need to use some kind of version control tool eventually.

You don’t have to be a Git “ninja.” It’s enough to be aware of the basics, like creating and using repositories and knowing how to commit changes.

### **5. XML Basics**

XML stands for Extensible Markup Language and is mostly used in the development of web solutions. Nevertheless, it is an essential technology for Android app development as well, due to the fact XML is used to access web data. Since many Android apps require transferring data to web services and vice versa, XML is a must-have skill to master.

### **6. Understanding of Material Design Guidelines**

Every Android app has to be aligned with the Material Design language guidelines that cover all essential elements in apps (colors, shades, transitions, element placement, etc.) Otherwise, the app may not be approved to publish to the Google Play Store. Many job postings for Android developers require this.

### **7. Android Studio**

The knowledge of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Android Studio or any other is also an important skill to have. Familiarity with Android Studio will help you work more efficiently. In particular, you can benefit from the built-in debugger and testing tools to write bug-free code.
