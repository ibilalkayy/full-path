# What Is a Front-End Developer?

A front-end developer, also known as a front-end web developer, is a professional responsible for the design and implementation of the interface. The users require this interface so that they can access the application in question. A web designer is a professional who creates a website’s appearance and design. And the front-end developer makes sure that the design works online by using coding languages such as *CSS*, *HTML*, and *JavaScript*.

# Front-End Developer Roles and Responsibilities

If you're wondering what a front-end developer does, he must:

- Decide web page design and structure.
- Develop features to enhance the users experience.
- Striking a balance between functional and aesthetic design.
- Make sure the web design is smartphone-capable.
- Build reusable code for future use.
- Make sure web pages are optimized for best speed and scalability.
- Employ a diverse selection of markup languages to design web pages.
- Keep the brand consist throughout the whole design.

# A Roadmap for Front-End

The first step is to start learning some of the fundamental skills that front-end developers use on a day-to-day basis. Let’s take a look at what you need to learn.

Front-end web developers use three primary coding languages to code the website.

## **Step 1: HTML + CSS**

When you’re starting with web development, it’s important that you first learn *HTML* and *CSS*, which are the fundamentals of learning how to build websites. It would be best if you learned how to structure responsive static pages to start your web development journey.

### **Markup Language**

*HTML* stands for *HyperText Markup Language* and is used for the creation of websites. When added to a plain text document, *HTML* tags describe how this document should be displayed by a web browser. To understand how *HTML* works, let’s take the example of bold tags. The *HTML* version would be written as follows:

    <b>Make this sentence bold!</b>

### **Style sheet language**

A style sheet is basically a set of stylistic rules. Style sheet languages are used, quite literally, to style documents that are written in markup languages.

Consider a document written in *HTML* and styled using *CSS* (Cascading Style Sheets), a style sheet language. The *HTML* is responsible for the content and structure of the web page, while *CSS* determines how this content should be presented visually. *CSS* can be used to add colours, change fonts, insert backgrounds and borders, as well as to style forms. *CSS* is also used to optimize web pages for responsive design, ensuring they adapt their layout to whatever device the user is on.

You can also learn a *CSS* framework like Materialize or Bootstrap, which significantly speeds up your development, but it’s not needed.

## **Step 2: Javascript**

The next step is to learn *Javascript*. You should learn basic concepts like data types, variables, general conventions, string manipulation, arithmetic and operators, control statements, loops, etc. 

Learning the basics of *Javascript* will make it easier for you when you’re applying *Javascript* to the client-side code or front-end.

### **DOM & jQuery**

After you learn javascript fundamentals, you should learn how to manipulate the DOM and jQuery, which is a javascript library that makes DOM manipulation easier. Now you know how to create dynamic pages.

A front end web developer is also in charge of making sure that there are no errors or bugs on the front end, as well as making sure that the design appears as it’s supposed to across various platforms and browsers. All of these tasks are important for a good user experience.

### **Libraries and Frameworks**

Web designers also work with libraries and frameworks. Despite much confusion, they are not the same thing—although they are both there to make the developer’s job easier.

Libraries and frameworks are essentially sets of prewritten code, but libraries are smaller and tend to be used for more specific use-cases. A library contains a collection of useful code, grouped together to be reused later. The purpose of a library is to enable developers to reach the same end goal while writing less code to get there.

*JavaScript* frameworks (including Angular, Backbone, Ember, Vue.js, and React) give a ready-made structure to your *JavaScript* code. There are different types of *JavaScript* frameworks for different needs, though the five mentioned are the most popular in actual job listings (especially React).

While learning *JavaScript* frameworks does take time, they really speed up development by giving you a jumpstart, and can be used with libraries like jQuery to minimize how much from-scratch coding you have to do (if you have time, you can find some free tutorial also).

## **Step 3: TypeScript**

### **What is TypeScript?**

In short, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that has optional typing and compiles to plain JavaScript.

In simpler words, TypeScript technically is JavaScript with static typing, whenever you want to have it.

Now, what would be the reasons for adding static typing to JavaScript?

I can list at least three:

- You can avoid masterfully-hidden-ninja errors like the classic `'undefined' is not a function`. 
- It is easier to refactor code without breaking it significantly.
- Orienting oneself in complex, large-scale systems is not a nightmare anymore.

### **Types of TypeScript**

TypeScript has a variety of basic types, like Boolean, Number, String, Array, Tuple, etc. Some of these don’t exist in JS; you can learn more about them in the documentation of TypeScript.

In addition to those, here are some other types we want to feature to showcase the expressivity of TS:

- Any & Unknown
- Void
- Never
- Intersection & Union types

### **3 reasons why you should choose TypeScript over JavaScript**

- TypeScript is more reliable.
- TypeScript is more explicit.
- TypeScript and JavaScript are practically interchangeable, so why not?

## **Step 4: Responsive and Mobile Design**

It’s no wonder that responsive and mobile design skills are super important to employers. Responsive design means that the site’s layout (and sometimes functionality and content) change based on the screen size and device someone is using.

*For example*, when you visit a website from a desktop computer with a big monitor, you’ll see multiple columns, big graphics, and interaction created specifically for mouse and keyboard users. On a mobile device, the same website would appear as a single column optimized for touch interaction, but using the same base files.

Mobile design can include responsive design, but can also mean creating separate mobile-specific designs. Sometimes the experience you want a user to have when visiting your site on a desktop computer is entirely different from what you want them to see when visiting from their smartphone.

In those cases, it makes sense for the mobile site to be completely different. A bank website with online banking would benefit from a separate mobile site that lets users view things like the closest bank location and a simplified account view (since mobile screens are smaller).

## **Step 5: Experience with RESTful Services and APIs**

Without getting too technical on this one, REST stands for Representational State Transfer. In basic terms, it’s a lightweight architecture that simplifies network communication on the web, and RESTful services and APIs are web services that adhere to REST architecture.

Let’s say you wanted to write an app that shows you all of your social media friends in the order in which you became friends. You could make calls to Facebook’s RESTful API to read your friends list and return that data. As a front end web developer, you could call Twitter’s API as well (Twitter also uses RESTful APIs). The general process is the same for any service that uses RESTful APIs, only the data returned will be different.

While it all sounds really complicated and technical, it’s a simple set of guidelines and practices that sets expectations so you know how to communicate with a web service. It also makes a web service perform better, scale better, work more reliably, and be easier to modify or move.

## **Step 6: Version Control System**

Version control systems let you keep track of changes that have been made to code over time. They also make it easy to revert back to an earlier version if you screw something up.

Let’s say you add a customized jQuery plugin and suddenly half of your other code breaks. Rather than having to scramble to manually undo it and fix all of the errors, you can roll back to a previous version and then try it again with a different solution — like hitting a reset button.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the most widely used of these version control management systems and can be installed using the command line. Knowing how to use Git is going to be a requirement for virtually any development job, be it front-end development, back-end development, or full-stack development. This is one of those vital job skills that developers need to have but few actually talk about.
