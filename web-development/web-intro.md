# What is web development?

Web Development is the process of building websites and applications for the internet. Web development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather, it’s all about the coding and programming that powers the website’s functionality.

From the most simple, static web pages to social media platforms and apps, from e-commerce websites to content management systems (CMS)—all the tools we use via the internet on a daily basis have been built by developers.

# Choose a Development Specialization

As you continue to grow your skills, you’ll need to choose an area of specialization. But what are the types of web development? All Web Developers are categorized into three main types:

## Front-End Developer

A Front-End Developer works on the “client-side” of web development, meaning any portion of the site or app that users interact with. This can include a site’s layout, design, and the way users interact with it.

Front-End developers use below technologies to interact with the browser.

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- JavaScript
- TypeScript

## Back-End Developer 

A Back-End Developer works on the “server-side” of web development. This is focused on the way a site functions and can include databases, servers, networks and hosting, and more.

Back-End programming languages include:

- Java
- Golang
- Python
- NodeJS

You can start with any one of them.

## Full-Stack Developer 

A Full-Stack Developer is familiar with both front-and back-end development and works with both sides of a website. They understand, and can work across, the “full stack” of technology: i.e. both the frontend and the backend. Full stack developers are experts in every stage of the web development process, meaning they are well-equipped to get hands on.

## The difference between web development and web design

Just like with software engineering, you might also hear the terms “web development” and “web design” used interchangeably, but these are two very different things.

Imagine a web designer and web developer working together to build a car: the developer would take care of all the functional components, like the engine, the wheels and the gears, while the designer would be responsible for both the visual aspects—how the car looks, the layout of the dashboard, the design of the seats—and for the user experience provided by the car.

## Note: 

You’re probably not going to see many job listings that say a company is looking for a “backend developer.” Instead, you’ll find listings looking for Ruby developers or Python developers, etc., because the actual programming language a developer knows is key to being the right fit for a particular job.
