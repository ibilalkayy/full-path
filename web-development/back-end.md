# What Is a Back-End Developer?

# What does a backend developer do?

Backend developer are in charge of the proper functioning of a web application. They write logical code to implement the functionality and enhance the speed and efficiency of a web app.

This means that a backend developer is responsible for:

- Implementation of the backend web architecture that comprises servers, databases, operation systems.
- Handling client requests with APIs.
- Managing database(s) and caching.
- Creating the business logic to run the application.
- Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks using scientific debugging.
- Build reusable code and libraries for future use.
- Optimizing functionality, page loading speed and scability of the application.
- Improving site infrastructure with timely enhancements and upgrades.


# Back-End developer skills

## **1. Programming language and backend frameworks**

It goes without saying that to be a skilled backend developer, it is crucial to master a programming language. The backend written in a specific language is used to communicate with the frontend of the web application.

Along with programming language, backend frameworks are an integral part of web development. They enable you to organize your code in a structured way and improve efficiency by reducing repetitive work.

### **Golang**

Developed by Google in 2009, Golang is an open-source language that has been steadily gaining traction. Go makes an ideal choice for backend web development, particularly for high-performing concurrent services on the server side.

Go makes an ideal choice for backend web development, particularly for high-performing concurrent services on the server side. Where speed and scalability are needed, Go is often opted. It is the perfect language for writing microservices.

#### **Beego Framework**

Beego is also a popular Go framework mainly used to build enterprise-level web applications with rapid development. This framework has four major parts: base modules, web server, tasks, and clients. The major features of Beego include support for enterprise applications and namespace routing. Like popular frameworks like Django, Beego also uses the MVC architecture to handle specific development aspects in an app. 

You can find more frameworks [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang2/comments/sior3k/golang_web_development_everything_you_need_to_know/).


### **Java**

With a widely supported open-source ecosystem, Java is most relevant backend language used by several product companies. This is because it is incredibly versatile and allows developers to run code on any device from smartphones to smart cards.

It is used to develop mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games. Knowing Java opens a great deal of doors for you as a developer.

#### **Spring Boot Framework**

Highly recommended to ease out dependency and kickstart new development projects in no time. Spring Boot is one of the top Java backend frameworks used for robust web application development.

### **JavaScript**

A huge benefit of this language is that it can be used for both frontend and backend.

If you're looking to grow as a full-stack developer, there is no better time to start mastering this language as **JavaScript is the #1 skill** hiring managers have begun looking for since 2020.

#### **Express Framework**

It is a web framework used in node.js(an open source server environment). This JavaScript framework is one of the most popular backend development tools in a developer's toolkit as it works seamlessly with Angular.js(frontend JavaScript framework).


### **Python**

Known for its simplicity, Python is a fast-growing language among developers who are just starting out.

Easy syntax and fewer lines of code put Python at a competitive advantage over other languages when it comes to efficient backend development and lighter maintenance.

#### **Django Framework**

Highly flexible and fairly simple to use, this Python framework is based on the **"batteries included"** approach. This means, Django provides libraries and tools to implement out-of-box functionalities instead of having to rely on separate libraries for the same.

Another popular Python-based framework that is equally loved and used by developers is **Flask**.

## **2. Database Management**

Databases are used to store data and save memory load of the web server. When a client makes a data request, the backend acts as a middleman to retrieve the corresponding response from the database and send it to the client. A client can also submit data to be added to the database.

As a backend developer, you must be familiar with database concepts to store data in the database(MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) and also caching(Redis) for quick access of data.

## **3. Handling APIs**

An Application Programming Interface (API) acts as a bridge layer between two applications. It acceps incoming requests to a backend application, retrieves the relevant and returns it in a response message.

This communication is done through clearly defined HTTP methods such as:

- **GET**: used to retrieve a resource.
- **DELETE**: used to delete a resource.
- **PUT**: used to create or replace a resource.
- **POST**: used to store a new resource.

You can use APIs to fetch data for your application. For instance, if you are building a weather forcasting application, you will need real-time weather data of particular places. You can get this data from OpenWeatherMap API.

## **4. Version Control System**

Software version control systems store all the previous versions of your code in repositories so that they can be accessed later. This is useful, especially when you lose some piece of your code or if a bug is introduced.

Having a software version control system like Git, enables you to roll back to previous version of the codebase.

Git also allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project. Each developer works on their own Git branches. When features are ready to be integrated into the main application, the relevant Git branches are merged into the main branch which is then deployed to the staging servers (where all the features are tested together) and eventually to the production application servers.

### **Become a confident backend developer**

Now that you a good idea of what you should learn, the next step is to **start learning**.

They are plenty of tutorials online that will teach you how to code, but the best way is to **Learn by Doing**.

Only when you build something on your own, you understand how the backend a web application works.

You can do this by making projects to deepen your programming skills and get hands-on with backend frameworks and tools you want to learn.

### **Pro tips:**

- Don't wait till you learn enough theory before starting a project.
- Leverage GitHub to learn more from other developers. Study their code and analyze how they went about solving technical challenges similar to your case.
- Be patient with yourself. Bugs in your code makes you a better problem solver. Use scientific debugging principles to narrow down your challenges.
- Go through what other developers have to say in forums like StackOverflow.
