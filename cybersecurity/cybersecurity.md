# How to get into CyberSecurity

## What is CyberSecurity?

Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems such as hardware, software, and data from cyber threats. The practice is used by individuals and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized systems.

To protect everything that is connected to the internet is called cybersecurity. It may be a mobile, a computer, a website, an app, a networking device, or any electronic device even if it is a car or an airplane.

So you can’t master all of them because learning these technologies will take time. You should define the target that which thing you want to hack or protect and then learn those technologies.

## What are the elements of cybersecurity and how does it work?

The cybersecurity field can be broken down into several different sections.

- **Application security** specialists find and fix vulnerabilities in the source code of desktop, mobile, and web applications, which are attractive target for criminals. Application security specialists are intimately familiar with one or more programming languages and common vulnerabilities, and can be involved in everything from design and development to deployment, upgrade, and maintenance.

- **Information and data security** ensure that a business’s data—including user data—is protected against theft, alteration, or destruction. A good information security expert will understand risk assessment and management, have knowledge of ISO policies and security architecture, and be able to implement appropriate defenses and guide a company’s response to breaches.

- **Network security** experts make sure that all the components of a company’s network are protected against threats and leaks by preventing unauthorized access. It’s often a company’s first line of defense and requires an understanding of routing and switching, network security protocols, and common threats like DoS attacks.

- **Cloud security**, which combines aspects of network and data security, ensures the safe use of web applications and the secure transmission of user data. Cloud computing comes with its own set of challenges, and experts in this field will want to be familiar with the languages, like Python, and ecosystems, like Amazon AWS, that most cloud architectures rely on.

- **Endpoint security** ensures that servers communicate securely with endpoints, which can include personal and corporate devices like computers and tablets, infrastructure like streetlights, and the growing Internet of Things. Endpoint specialists are involved in configuring and deploying protection platforms and ensuring endpoints are compliant and up to date. Thus, they need to be familiar with a variety of vulnerabilities along the endpoint-server corridor.

## What are the different types of cybersecurity threats?

The process of keeping up with new technologies, security trends and threat intelligence is a challenging task. It is necessary in order to protect information and other assets from cyber threats, which take many forms. Types of cyber threats include:

- **Malware** is a form of malicious software in which any file or program can be used to harm a computer user. This includes worms, viruses, Trojans, and spyware.

- **Ransomware** is another type of malware. It involves an attacker locking the victim's computer system files -- typically through encryption -- and demanding a payment to decrypt and unlock them.

- **Social engineering** is an attack that relies on human interaction to trick users into breaking security procedures to gain sensitive information that is typically protected.

- **Phishing** is a form of social engineering where fraudulent email or text messages that resemble those from reputable or known sources are sent. Often random attacks, the intent of these messages is to steal sensitive data, such as credit card or login information.

- **Spear phishing** is a type of phishing attack that has an intended target user, organization, or business.

- **Insider threats** are security breaches or losses caused by humans -- for example, employees, contractors, or customers. Insider threats can be malicious or negligent in nature.

- **Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks** are those in which multiple systems disrupt the traffic of a targeted system, such as a server, website, or other network resources. By flooding the target with messages, connection requests, or packets, the attackers can slow the system or crash it, preventing legitimate traffic from using it.

- **Advanced persistent threats (APTs)** are prolonged targeted attacks in which an attacker infiltrates a network and remains undetected for long periods of time with the aim to steal data.

- **Man-in-the-middle (MitM)** attacks are eavesdropping attacks that involve an attacker intercepting and relaying messages between two parties who believe they are communicating with each other.

## What are the career opportunities in cybersecurity?

As the cyber threat landscape continues to grow and new threats emerge -- such as IoT threats -- individuals are needed with cybersecurity awareness and hardware and software skills
IT professionals and other computer specialists are needed in security roles, such as:
- **The chief information security officer (CISO)** is the individual who implements the security program across the organization and oversees the IT security department's operations.

- **The chief security office (CSO)** is the executive responsible for the physical and/or cybersecurity of a company.

- **Security engineers** protect company assets from threats with a focus on quality control within the IT infrastructure.

- **Security architects** are responsible for planning, analyzing, designing, testing, maintaining, and supporting an enterprise's critical infrastructure.

- **Security analysts** have several responsibilities that include planning security measures and controls, protecting digital files, and conducting both internal and external security audits.

- **Penetration testers** are ethical hackers who test the security of systems, networks and applications, seeking vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.

- **Threat hunters** are threat analysts who aim to uncover vulnerabilities and attacks and mitigate them before they compromise a business.

Other cybersecurity careers include security consultants, data protection officers, cloud security architects, security operations manager (SOC) managers and analysts, security investigators, cryptographers, and security administrators.

## Basic education requirements for cybersecurity jobs.

Cyber security is a vast field with different job roles. No matter your background, there is something you can contribute to the cyber security discussion. Because of this, the educational requirements for cyber security vary. For instance, many entry-level cyber security jobs do not require a bachelor’s degree in cyber security or even a related field. 
On the other hand, more advanced jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree or a master’s in some cases. 

The position of a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), a mid-executive level employee who plans, coordinates, and directs an organization’s cyber security blueprint, requires a minimum of a bachelor’s degree in cyber security or similar fields and 7–12 years of experience in a similar field. A master’s degree in the mentioned fields is advantageous as some larger companies require at least a Master’s degree in cyber security or a related field.

### **Where to practice?**

**Bug Bounties**

Bug bounties are a great way to get web app pentesting experience because you get to hack web applications in a production environment. Bug bounties are rewards tech companies offer people who find bugs in their software and hardware. By participating in bug bounties, you gain the skills you need to become a pentester, and the experience you gain is helpful in interviews because you can explain how to perform a pentest and use pentesting tools, as well as discuss vulnerabilities, how to exploit them, and how to remediate them. 

While most bug bounties are for web apps, there are also automotive bug bounties, hardware bug bounties, and IoT bug bounties. Some bug bounty companies also do pentests, and you could get the opportunity to participate in those (bug bounties are basically crowd-sourced pentests). Some companies, like Facebook and Google, host their own bug bounties. Others hire companies to conduct bug bounty programs for them. 

Most bug bounty companies only require that you simply register a researcher account, but others may require an interview to join.

**CTF**

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a kind of information security competition that challenges contestants to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a scavenger hunt on wikipedia to basic programming exercises to hacking your way into a server to steal data. In these challenges, the contestant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text that may be hidden on the server or behind a webpage. This goal is called the flag, hence the name!

Like many competitions, the skill level for CTFs varies between the events. Some are targeted towards professionals with experience operating on cyber security teams. These typically offer a large cash reward and can be held at a specific physical location. Other events target the high school and college student range, sometimes offering monetary support for education to those that place highly in the competition!

**Challenge types**

- **Cryptography** - Typically involves decrypting or encrypting a piece of data
- **Steganography** - Tasked with finding information hidden in files or images
